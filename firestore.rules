/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a security model based on user roles and data ownership.
 * It establishes a clear distinction between standard users and privileged administrators. Standard
 * users have control over their own data (like their user profile and SOS alerts), while administrators
 * have exclusive access to system-wide collections like incident reports. Security guards have the
 * specific ability to create incidents, but cannot view the full collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profiles, only accessible by the owner. Contains a 'role' field.
 * - /incidents/{incidentId}: Sensitive reports. Guards can create them, but only administrators can read/manage them.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Collaborative documents shared between two specific users (a student and staff member).
 * - /sos_alerts/{sosAlertId}: User-owned emergency alerts, which are also visible to administrators for safety monitoring.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin-Only Read/Manage for Incidents: The '/incidents' collection is locked down for read and management to users
 *   with the 'administrator' role, enforcing strict confidentiality.
 * - Guard-Specific Create for Incidents: Users with the 'guard' role are granted permission to create new incident reports.
 * - No User Listing: To protect user privacy, listing the entire '/users' collection is disabled for all clients.
 * - Shared Ownership: Appointments in '/appointments' are accessible only to the two participants defined in the document,
 *   enabling collaborative but private scheduling.
 * - Default Deny: Access is denied by default. Rules are written to explicitly grant permissions based on defined logic.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - A 'role' field is stored directly on each document in the '/users' collection. This avoids costly cross-collection `get()`
 *   calls in most rules and allows for a simple, performant role check.
 * - Appointment documents contain 'studentId' and 'staffId' fields, allowing rules to authorize access without needing to look up
 *   related documents.
 * - SOS alerts contain a 'uid' field, which directly links the alert to its owner for straightforward ownership checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Sensitive data (incidents) is placed in a separate top-level collection, '/incidents'.
 *   This makes it simple to write secure rules that segregate create and manage permissions based on role.
